    <h2>Blockquote</h2>
    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation">The Dirty Harry quotation "Do you feel lucky, punk?" is a rewording
    of the original dialogue: "You've got to ask yourself one question:
      'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya, punk?" Humphrey Bogart's character
      Rick in Casablanca never said "Play it again, Sam."
      The actual expression is Play it, Sam. Mae West did not say
      Why don't you come up sometime and see me? in She Done Him Wrong,
      but rather Why don't you come up and see me sometime?</blockquote><br>
